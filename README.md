[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## 📝 Overview

## A sophisticated movie recommendation system built using TreeMultimap data structure in C++. This project implements a Netflix-style movie recommendation algorithm that suggests films based on user ratings and preferences. It collects from the MovieDatabase and UserDatabase classes to recommend movies in under how many movies do you want to recommend e.g 10,20,300,1000 movies! And it can hold up to 100K Movies!

## 🚀 Key Features

- Custom TreeMultimap implementation for efficient data storage
- Movie recommendation engine
- User rating system
- Similar movie finder
- Performance optimized data structure

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C++
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- Custom Data Structures
- Algorithm Optimization
